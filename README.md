# Fast-Circlet-Transform
Fast Circlet Transform for bullet impact detection. The codes were adapted to detect holes made by bullet impacts

The codes provided here is the implementation of the Circlet Transform (CT) proposed by Chauris et al [1], as well as, some demo showing the application of the CT.  The CT is a state of the art and robust tool for detecting objects with circular patterns in which binary image segmentation is no longer needed.
